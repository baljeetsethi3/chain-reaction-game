HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:If u do not have any java complier like bluej installed on your computer then do it firstly as the whole program is written in java so need to be compiled before running.
After compiling the program just create a new instance of the "play game" class and enjoy playing a very simple desktop version of game. 
AUTHORS:Baljeet Singh
USER INSTRUCTIONS:Make sure that you install the whole project instead of the just the classes because there are images required by the program to run and create gui.
